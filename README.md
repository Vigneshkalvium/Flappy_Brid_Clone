# Flappy Bird Game (MERN Stack)

## Description
Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive game where players control a bird that must navigate through a series of obstacles (pipes) by tapping or clicking to keep it airborne. The objective is to survive as long as possible without hitting the pipes or the ground.

## Tech Stack

## Day 1 - Setting Up the Environment

 - I have created the project repository and set up the basic folder structure.
 - I am using the `npm create vite@latest` command to create a new React app.
 - I have installed the necessary dependencies for the frontend and backend.
 - I have set up the server and client folders for the backend and frontend, respectively.
